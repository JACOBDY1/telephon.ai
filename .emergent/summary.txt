The AI engineer's work evolved from stabilizing an existing telephony platform to a deep dive into the HairPro IL Advanced system. Initial focus included fixing frontend errors and expanding CRM/PWA features. A significant pivot involved extracting HairPro into static HTML due to user access issues, though the main React component () remained problematic with syntax errors, particularly concerning a large .

Recent efforts aimed at resolving these frontend issues and integrating comprehensive backend support for professional user types, including detailed client, formula, inventory, and appointment management. The AI engineer meticulously debugged  by rewriting it and then focused on  to update user models and add new API endpoints for user profiles and subscriptions. Despite initial success and demo data population, frontend display issues persisted, leading to troubleshooting the React application's caching and component rendering. The latest user feedback introduced an extensive new specification for the HairPro system, prompting the AI engineer to begin implementing a PostgreSQL backend and further enhancing the frontend with dedicated management components. The work is currently focused on adding an  component, which encountered a lint error.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build an advanced AI-powered telephony platform (like Dialpad), integrating VoIP, real-time transcription, AI sentiment analysis, and omnichannel communication, with a responsive PWA UI and Chrome extension, supporting RTL (Hebrew). Core functionalities include CRM, Web Dialer, Module Manager, user/subscription/notification systems, advanced CRM, call flow canvas, and employee attendance. A key feature is the Smart Barber/Therapist Management System (HairPro IL Advanced), which requires a real-time dashboard, digital weighing, advanced client management (history, chemistry), smart inventory (AI forecasting), appointment scheduling, business reports, intelligent notifications, and integrations (Google Calendar, WhatsApp Business, payments, SMS, email). It mandates full Hebrew RTL and mobile-first design. Initially delivered as static HTML due to live app issues, the system now requires full integration into the main React application with comprehensive backend and frontend functionality for professional users. The latest request detailed a PostgreSQL backend with , , , , , ,  tables, Web Bluetooth scale integration, specific functions for formula cost, smart inventory, automated reminders, and analytics, alongside robust UI/UX (responsive, RTL, offline) and security (JWT, encryption).

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The initial project structure includes:



-   ****: Contains the UI and logic for HairPro IL Advanced, including . This file was repeatedly causing syntax errors due to the extensive color database integration. The AI engineer attempted to fix it by rewriting parts, adding internal navigation for Dashboard, Colors, Clients, and Reports, and ensuring the  is accessible.
-   ****: The FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes**: Updated significantly. It now includes  and  models, and CRUD endpoints for attendance/booking. User models (, , , , , ) were expanded to include  (e.g., professional) and  details. New API endpoints were added for user profile management, subscription management, and fetching professional users. Demo data generation was modified to include a professional user. Crucially, the code was refactored to correctly pass  and  through authentication and user retrieval functions (, , ). Error handling for  objects in MongoDB serialization was fixed for dashboard and demo data endpoints. The latest work involves adding , , , , , , and  models, along with corresponding API endpoints for a comprehensive HairPro system. Professional classes for , , , , and  were also added.
-   ****: Python dependencies for the backend.  and  were added.
-   ****: A new script to populate MongoDB with demo data for the attendance and booking system.
-   ****: Main React component for routing and global state.
    -   **Changes**: Imports for  and  were added. The routing logic was updated to render  for the 'profile' tab and  for the 'workflowSystem' and a new 'hairProAdvanced' tab. The  was temporarily used to verify frontend changes.
-   ****: Navigation component.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to include navigation links for 'UserProfileManager' and a dedicated 'HairPro IL Advanced' menu item for professional users.
-   ****: **(New File)** Created to manage user profiles and subscription settings.
-   ****: **(New File)** A simple green test page created temporarily to visually confirm frontend updates to the user.
-   ****: Login page component.
    -   **Changes**: Added a prominent green System Update - Changes Available! message and included the professional user in the demo user list for easy access and visibility.
-   ****: **(New File, in progress)** This component is being created as part of the new comprehensive HairPro specification to handle advanced formula calculations and management. Currently, its creation resulted in a lint error.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most recent work involves a major overhaul and expansion of the HairPro IL Advanced system based on a detailed specification provided by the user.

1.  **Backend Expansion ()**:
    *   The backend models have been significantly expanded to include comprehensive schemas for , , , , , , and , moving towards the PostgreSQL schema outlined in the new requirements (though still implemented in MongoDB).
    *   New professional-level classes and functions like  (mocked in server), , , , and  have been added to  to support real-time cost calculation, smart inventory management, automated reminders, and data analytics for the HairPro system.
    *   A large number of new API endpoints (, , , , , etc.) have been introduced to manage these new professional data types and functionalities.
    *   Demo data generation has been updated to populate these new comprehensive data types for testing.
    *   Recent debugging also addressed  serialization issues with MongoDB in dashboard and demo data endpoints.

2.  **Frontend Development (, )**:
    *   The  component has been updated to render various sections, including a dashboard and a comprehensive color database. Internal navigation within this component for different tabs (Dashboard, Colors, Clients, Reports) has been enhanced.
    *   A new component, , is being created to handle the advanced formula calculation and management, including integration with the digital weighing scale (Bluetooth). The immediate status is that the creation of this file resulted in a lint/parsing error (). This is the current blocking issue.

In summary, the work has shifted to implementing the full, detailed HairPro IL Advanced product specification, starting with the backend data models and APIs, and moving into the complex frontend components, with the current focus on resolving a specific lint error during the development of .
