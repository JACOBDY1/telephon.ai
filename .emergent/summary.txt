The AI engineer's initial work focused on stabilizing an AI-powered telephony platform, including fixing frontend errors and expanding CRM, attendance, and PWA features. A major pivot occurred with the HairPro IL Advanced system. Initially, it was integrated into the React app as , but persistent user access issues and RTL layout problems led to its extraction into static HTML files.

Recent efforts included adding backend models and endpoints for an attendance and booking system to  and updating . Concurrently, the AI engineer addressed user feedback regarding missing comprehensive color and chemical product data for the HairPro IL Advanced inventory. The attempt to update  with this extensive  has repeatedly resulted in syntax errors, which the AI engineer is actively trying to resolve, indicating the immediate priority is debugging this frontend component.

The primary objective is to build an advanced AI-powered telephony platform akin to Dialpad, integrating with Checkcall and MasterPBX for VoIP, virtual numbers, real-time transcription, AI sentiment analysis, and omnichannel communication. This requires a responsive web UI, PWA mobile apps, and a Chrome extension, emphasizing performance, scalability, reliability, and multi-language (RTL, Hebrew) support.

Initial development focused on React frontend and FastAPI backend stabilization, core CRM CRUD operations, a Web Dialer, Module Manager, and user/subscription/notification functionalities. Subsequent additions included advanced CRM features, a visual call flow canvas, an employee attendance system, and a full PWA.

A central requirement is the Smart Barber/Therapist Management System (HairPro IL Advanced), encompassing a real-time dashboard, digital weighing, next-gen client management (history, chemistry), smart inventory (AI forecasting), advanced appointment scheduling, business reports, intelligent notifications, and integrations with Google Calendar, WhatsApp Business, payments, SMS, and email. It mandates full Hebrew RTL and mobile-first design. Due to user access issues with the live app, the HairPro system was explicitly requested and delivered as static HTML files.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **UI/UX**: Responsive Design, Tailwind CSS, RTL (Right-to-Left) support.
-   **API Integrations**: Checkcall API, MasterPBX API, Web Bluetooth API (for digital scale), Google Calendar API, WhatsApp Business API.
-   **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt, React Context.
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.
-   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Service Workers, Manifest.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, organized in a standard full-stack directory structure. New static HTML files for the HairPro feature are at the root.


-   ****: Main React component for routing and global state, configured for RTL and sidebar integration.
-   ****: Navigation component, refactored for responsiveness, mobile overlay, and RTL (right-to-left) behavior.
-   ****: Top navigation bar, adjusted for RTL layout and sidebar interaction.
-   ****: Contains the comprehensive UI and mock logic for HairPro IL Advanced, including Dashboard, AdvancedFormulaManager (with digital weighing), SmartInventoryManager, AppointmentScheduler, AdvancedClientManager, and . This file is currently undergoing updates to include an extensive  but is encountering syntax errors.
-   ****: The FastAPI backend. Recently updated to include  and  models, and corresponding CRUD endpoints (create, get, get all, update, delete) for attendance and booking. This expanded the application's core backend functionality.
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.  and  were recently added for planned document generation and environment variable access.
-   ** (New)**: A script created to populate MongoDB with demo data for the newly implemented attendance and booking system, allowing for initial testing and demonstration.
-   ****: Frontend component for attendance, recently targeted for updates to integrate with the new backend attendance API, moving from mock data to real API calls.
-   ****, ****, ****, ****, ****: These are new static HTML files in the  root, representing the standalone UI of HairPro IL Advanced, created to fulfill a user request for direct access outside the main React application.  serves as their entry point.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most recent work involves two main threads:
1.  **Backend Development for Attendance/Booking**: The backend in  has been updated with new FastAPI models (, ) and a full set of CRUD API endpoints to manage attendance and bookings. Necessary Python packages (, ) have been added to , installed, and the backend server restarted. A new script, , was created and executed to pre-fill the database with demo data for this system. The next logical step for this thread is to update the frontend component, , to utilize these new backend APIs, moving away from mock data.
2.  **Frontend Enhancement and Debugging for HairPro IL Advanced**: The user requested that the  component (HairPro IL Advanced) include a comprehensive  with detailed information for various brands and series (Schwarzkopf, Indola, L'Oreal). The AI engineer attempted to replace the existing  within  with the extensive one provided by the user. However, this operation has repeatedly failed due to syntax errors, leading to multiple attempts to rewrite and fix the file. This ongoing syntax error resolution in  is the immediate and most recent active task. The HairPro IL Advanced functionality currently exists as both a React component (with integration issues) and a set of static HTML files.

<optional_next_step>
Resolve the persistent syntax error in  to correctly integrate the comprehensive color database.
