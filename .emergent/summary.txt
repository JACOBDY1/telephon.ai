The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing and expanding the HairPro IL Advanced system. Initially, efforts were directed at resolving a persistent lint error in , which involved correcting a duplicate variable declaration. Following this, the engineer meticulously debugged and refactored backend logic in  and frontend components like  and  to ensure the professional user type was correctly authenticated and could access HairPro features.

A significant phase involved integrating new UI elements such as client/lead pop-ups, a sticky header, and a redesigned floating clock, while also connecting analytics, social sharing, and calendar-based goal systems. The latter part of the trajectory addressed crucial user feedback requesting that all HairPro IL Advanced features (goals, tips, attendance, formulas, inventory, clients, colors) be accessible to *all* user types, not just professionals. This required modifying API endpoints in  to remove  restrictions and ensuring frontend components correctly displayed this data for all authenticated users. The final actions confirmed successful implementation, making the system fully functional and accessible across all user profiles.

The overarching goal is to develop an advanced AI-powered telephony platform, similar to Dialpad, featuring VoIP, real-time transcription, AI sentiment analysis, and omnichannel communication. This includes a responsive PWA UI with Chrome extension support and RTL (Hebrew) capabilities. Core functionalities encompass CRM, Web Dialer, Module Manager, user/subscription/notification systems, call flow canvas, and employee attendance.

A central component is the Smart Barber/Therapist Management System (HairPro IL Advanced). This system requires a real-time dashboard, digital weighing integration, comprehensive client management (history, chemistry, allergies), smart inventory with AI forecasting, appointment scheduling, business reports, intelligent notifications, and integrations with Google Calendar, WhatsApp Business, payments, SMS, and email. It mandates full Hebrew RTL and mobile-first design. Initially delivered as static HTML, the system required full integration into the main React application with extensive backend and frontend support for professional users. Recent detailed specifications included a planned PostgreSQL backend with dedicated tables for , , , , , , and , along with Web Bluetooth scale integration for formula calculations, smart inventory, automated reminders, and analytics. The latest user requests emphasized making all HairPro IL Advanced features, including the goals, tips, attendance, formulas, inventory, clients, and colors, universally accessible to *all* user types (not just professional) within the application, alongside UI refinements like sticky headers and a repositioned floating clock widget.

-   ****: The FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Central API hub. Manages user authentication, CRM, attendance, and all HairPro-related data (clients, formulas, inventory, appointments, goals, communications).
    -   **Changes**: Extensive additions of , , , , , ,  models. Integrated , , , , . Added numerous API endpoints (, , etc.). Fixed  serialization issues. Crucially, modified authentication (, ) to correctly return  from DB (not default client) and removed  restrictions from many professional API endpoints (e.g., , , , , attendance endpoints) to make them accessible to all user types.
-   ****: Core React component for the HairPro IL Advanced system.
    -   **Importance**: The main UI for professional and now all users to manage salon operations, including dashboard, color database, client management, and formulas.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to integrate . Added state and functions for pop-ups (client, lead, goals), time/attendance management, and improved synchronization. Redesigned and repositioned the floating attendance clock. Implemented sticky header. Enhanced the UI to display analytics, social sharing buttons (Instagram, Google Reviews), and calendar-based goals. The component was also modified to ensure RTL display and data fetching logic for new features. Numerous syntax and lint errors were fixed through multiple iterations.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most recent work cycle focused on making all HairPro IL Advanced features universally accessible to all user types (e.g., , , , ) and refining the frontend UI.

**Key achievements in this phase:**
1.  **Backend Universal Access ()**: The  restrictions were systematically removed from all critical HairPro API endpoints. This included:
    *   : Now accessible to all users for fetching goals.
    *   : Client management (retrieval) is available to all.
    *   , , : Attendance tracking endpoints are open to all users.
    *   : Formula management is available to all users.
    *   : Inventory management is available to all users.
    *   This ensures that any logged-in user can access and utilize these core functionalities previously limited to professional profiles.

2.  **Frontend UI Enhancements ()**:
    *   The dashboard now features advanced analytics, tip tracking, review ratings, and efficiency metrics.
    *   Social sharing capabilities (Instagram, Google Reviews) are integrated with active buttons.
    *   Calendar-based goals are automatically updated and displayed.
    *   A Request Feedback button is included.
    *   The UI fully supports Hebrew RTL across all elements.
    *   The bottom navigation bar was fixed for correct RTL display and updated with 5 tabs: Dashboard, Formulas, Colors, Clients, Inventory.
    *   The header was made sticky to remain visible during scrolling.
    *   The floating attendance clock widget was resized and repositioned to the bottom-right, above the tabs, and visually indicates its active state.
    *   Pop-up modals for client cards and potential leads were integrated to enhance management workflows.
    *   All display of income is correctly formatted in Israeli Shekels (â‚ª).

    *   Initial backend  defaulting to client in login/user retrieval functions was fixed to accurately reflect the actual user type from the database.

The system is now fully functional, with all core HairPro features accessible and displayed correctly for all authenticated users, indicating a robust and production-ready application according to the last status update.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Given that the HairPro IL Advanced system is confirmed to be fully functional for all user types and the previous explicit user request has been fulfilled, the next step is to confirm with the user if any further enhancements or new features are desired.
