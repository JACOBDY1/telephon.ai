The AI engineer's trajectory shows a comprehensive development process for an AI-powered telephony platform. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the core application, fixing numerous frontend runtime errors primarily related to missing props, inconsistent interfaces, and incomplete translations, leading to a perfect product. Following this, the user requested further enhancements, including advanced CRM features, a call flow canvas, an enhanced attendance system, and a PWA mobile application. A significant shift occurred with the user's detailed request for a smart barber/therapist management system, which the AI engineer integrated as a Provider Management System and further refined into an Integrated Workflow System incorporating time, product, and goal management. The work culminated in significant UI/UX improvements, including a responsive sidebar and header, and a global search feature. The most recent task initiated by the user is the development of a dedicated Barber Professional App.

The primary objective is to develop a sophisticated AI-powered telephony platform akin to Dialpad, integrating with Checkcall and MasterPBX. Key functionalities include VoIP PBX, virtual numbers, real-time transcription, AI sentiment analysis, custom AI agents, and omnichannel communication (SMS, WhatsApp, email, chat). The platform requires a responsive web UI, mobile dialer apps, and a Chrome extension, with non-functional requirements for performance (10,000 concurrent calls, <100ms response), scalability, 99.99% reliability, and GDPR/CCPA security, supporting multiple languages (Hebrew, English, Russian, Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian).

Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the existing multi-language React frontend, backend authentication with FastAPI/bcrypt, and CRM CRUD operations. After resolving numerous frontend runtime errors and achieving a perfect product state (including a Web Dialer, Module Manager, user profile, subscription, and notification center), the user requested enhancements such as advanced CRM features (search, filters, export), a visual call flow canvas, an advanced employee attendance system with booking/lead pop-ups, and a full mobile application (PWA). A pivotal request emerged for a Smart Barber/Therapist Management System to manage schedules, goals, tips, product sales (as service-time), and client acquisition for service providers, to be integrated into the main platform, and then as a separate dedicated Barber Professional App.
