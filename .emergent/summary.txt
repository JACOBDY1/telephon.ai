The AI engineer successfully transitioned the AI-powered telephony platform from a UI-focused MVP to a more functional state. Initially, the work involved scaffolding the React frontend and integrating mock data, then progressing to real API integrations with Checkcall and MasterPBX. A significant architectural refactor modularized the monolithic  into numerous dedicated components for features like Dashboard, CRM, Attendance, and Marketplace, along with new placeholders for AI analytics, messaging, and document generation.

However, a critical user intervention highlighted that despite the rich UI, core functionalities like user authentication, data persistence (CRUD), and real-time data sync were missing, rendering the application a green screen. This led to a major pivot. The engineer is now diligently implementing a robust user authentication system on the backend using FastAPI and bcrypt, securing existing API endpoints. The immediate next step is to populate the database with demo users and then proceed to build actual CRUD operations for all components.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a sophisticated AI-powered telephony platform akin to Dialpad, integrating with existing Checkcall and MasterPBX systems. Core functionalities include VoIP PBX, virtual numbers, eSIM, real-time transcription, AI-driven sentiment analysis, custom AI agents, and omnichannel communication (SMS, WhatsApp, email, chat). A detailed dashboard for call analytics, an employee attendance system with booking/lead generation, and extensive CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Powerlink) are required. The platform needs a responsive web UI, mobile dialer apps, and a Chrome extension. Performance (10,000 concurrent calls, <100ms response), scalability (AWS/GCP), 99.99% reliability, and security (GDPR/CCPA) are key non-functional requirements. Business goals include competitive pricing, multi-language support (Hebrew, English, Russian, Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian), and an ambitious launch. So far, a multi-language React frontend with Checkcall/MasterPBX API integration has been built, and backend authentication is now being implemented.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: The core FastAPI backend handling API routes, business logic, and external integrations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially set up with mock data, then updated for real Checkcall and MasterPBX API calls with  and . Recent changes include the addition of user authentication logic, user models, login/registration endpoints, and the application of authentication requirements to all existing and newly added API endpoints. New endpoints for AI analytics, messaging, and other advanced features were also added.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that orchestrates the entire UI.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially a large, monolithic component, it was refactored significantly. Its content has been broken down into multiple dedicated component files (e.g., , , , , , , , , , ). It now serves as a central router and container, importing and rendering these modular components based on navigation. New components for , , , , and  have also been integrated into its structure and sidebar navigation.

<current_work>
Currently, the AI-powered telephony platform has a comprehensive React frontend with a sophisticated UI. The  has been refactored into over a dozen modular components (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ), significantly improving maintainability and scalability. Multi-language support and dark/light modes are functional.

The backend () initially integrated with real Checkcall and MasterPBX APIs for call data. The most recent and critical work initiated after user feedback is the implementation of a full-fledged user authentication system. This involves adding user models, authentication functions (e.g., password hashing with ), and API endpoints for user registration and login. Crucially, all existing and newly added backend API endpoints are now secured, requiring user authentication before access.

The immediate task being worked on is to populate the MongoDB database with demo users, ensuring the newly implemented authentication system can be tested and demonstrated to be functional, thus moving beyond the green screen UI state to a truly working application.
